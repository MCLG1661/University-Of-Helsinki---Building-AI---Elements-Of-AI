# HealthGuardian AI - Medical Triage System

Final Project For The Building AI Course

## üéØ Summary

HealthGuardian AI is an intelligent medical triage system that uses machine learning to analyze patient symptoms and provide preliminary medical assessments. The system processes natural language descriptions of symptoms, classifies potential conditions, determines urgency levels, and offers initial recommendations. Built with Python and Streamlit, it demonstrates practical applications of NLP and classification algorithms in healthcare technology.

## üè• Background & Problem Statement

This project addresses the problem of healthcare accessibility and emergency room overcrowding by providing an initial symptom assessment tool. Many people seek emergency care for non-urgent conditions due to lack of preliminary guidance. My motivation comes from observing healthcare challenges in underserved communities and the potential of AI to bridge accessibility gaps.

##How is it used?

Users interact with the system through a web interface where they describe their symptoms in natural language. The AI processes the text, analyzes symptom patterns, and returns:
- Possible medical conditions
- Urgency level (low/medium/high)
- Preliminary recommendations
- Guidance on when to seek medical care

The system is designed for initial assessment before consulting healthcare professionals.

## Data sources and AI methods

**Data Sources:**
- Synthetic medical symptom data
- Public health datasets
- Medical literature patterns

**AI Methods:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Random Forest Classification
- Multi-class prediction models

## Challenges

This project does not:
- Replace professional medical diagnosis
- Handle emergency situations
- Process medical images or lab results
- Provide treatment prescriptions

Limitations include dataset size, language constraints, and the need for clinical validation.

## What next?

Potential growth areas:
- Integration with electronic health records
- Multi-language support
- Mobile application development
- Clinical trial validation
- Specialized modules for chronic conditions
