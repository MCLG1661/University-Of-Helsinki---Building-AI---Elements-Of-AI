# Movie Recommendation System

## Summary  
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes movie features and synopses to suggest similar films to users, applying natural language processing (NLP) and cosine similarity metrics. This solution addresses the information overload problem in entertainment platforms by providing personalized movie discoveries.

## Background  
With the vast amount of movies available across streaming platforms, users often struggle to find content that matches their preferences. This recommendation system solves the problem of content discovery by:

* Helping users find movies similar to ones they already enjoy
* Reducing time spent browsing through irrelevant options
* Providing personalized suggestions based on content analysis
* Demonstrating practical application of AI in entertainment

The algorithm is particularly useful for movie enthusiasts, streaming services, and anyone looking to expand their viewing options with tailored recommendations.

## How is it used?  
The system can be deployed in various scenarios:

# Example usage
recommendations = get_similar_movies("The Matrix", num_recommendations=5)
